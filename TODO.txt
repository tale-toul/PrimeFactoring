-Create a batch of test cases to use with the program.  Something like a series of
numbers with its factors like 4=[2,2] 18=[2,2,3].  The I need an option in the program to
run the test cases and compare its the results with the ones saved

-Add a final check to the program, multiplying the resulting factors must yield the
original number.
