List of features pending 

-Create a batch of test cases to use with the program.  Something like a series
of numbers with its factors like 4=[2,2] 18=[2,2,3].  The I need an option in
the program to run the test cases and compare its the results with the ones
saved.  
To generate the test cases the program is run with an option that tells it to
save the result in a file.  If the file already exists it's read into a string
and then loaded with json, the result should be a dictionary.  The results of
the factorization are added to the dictionary after checking that the value is
not there yet,  and then saved to the file, if it doesn't exist (dictionary and
file) it is created


-Add the functionality that when the program is stoped with CTRL-C the program dumps the
factors found so far, the last candidate tried, and the time spent so far.


DONE

-Add a final check to the program, multiplying the resulting factors must yield the
original number. (Done in version 1.0.1)

-Move the core functionality of computing the factors into a function. (Done in version
1.0.2)

-Add the posibility to compute the time needed to factorize a number. (Done in version
1.0.2)

-Add an argument parser so the behaviour of the script can be changed.  For
this I will use the argparse standard python module
(https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html). (Done in version 1.0.3)

-Add an argument to tell the script that we want to save the result of
factoring the number to a file, the argument will have a parameter that is the
filename, if the file doesn't exist we create it. (Done in version 1.0.3)
